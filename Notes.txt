from Flask import Session, g
Flask session is a dictionary - session['user_id'] = u.id

@app.before_request is code that gets run before every request
def before_request():
	if "user_id" in Session:
		g.user = User.query.get(session['user_id'])
	else:


tutorial says you don't have to use g and before_session anymore - confusing

also maybe change session in part1 to db_session to reduce confusion

Turn on echo = True in development environment

MVC = Model View Conroller

render_template("index.html", user=g.user) user is the thing that is exposed to the user (i.e. Flask/Jinga)
